## Project Description üìÑ

Welcome to AdventureQuest! üåü

AdventureQuest is an immersive role-playing game (RPG) that transports players into a dynamic and enchanting fantasy world. It aims to provide gamers with a rich, interactive experience that combines strategic gameplay and levels development. 

## Features üåü

- üñºÔ∏è **Runtime View Switching**: Easily switch between 2D, overlay, and text-based views during program execution.
- üïπÔ∏è **Interactive Protagonist**: Control the protagonist using arrow keys for smooth navigation.
- üïπÔ∏è **Auto-Play Mode**: Activate auto-play mode where the protagonist takes charge automatically.
- ü¶π **XEnemy**: Encounter and deal with the mysterious XEnemy with unique behavior.
- üåê **Path Visualization**: Visualize the path followed by the protagonist during auto-play.
- üèûÔ∏è **Overlay Maps**: Experience a rich world with overlay maps, allowing for different visual and data layers.
- üåç **Multilevel Gameplay**: Transition between maps using special Tiles (Door/Portal) for diverse gameplay experiences.



## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

- C++ 20 are required for code compliation

## Getting Started üöÄ

- Observer pattern implemented for tile animations.
- Scaling function for graphical representation of items.

### Subtask B: Finished
- Graphical views and text views switchable via tabs.
- Text visualization in HTML format for color adaptation.
- ASCII art-like string-based visualization as an alternative.
- Color changes based on entity status.
- User interaction in text view via keypress or textual message widget.

### Subtask C: Finished
- Overlay with world map background.
- Graphical representation of tiles based on value.
- Special tile representations for different gameplay elements.
- Graphical scaling correlated with zoom functions.

### Subtask D: Finished
- Five initial world levels created.
- Level switch implemented for transitioning between maps.
- Sequential storage and indexing of world models for quick loading.

### Subtask E: Finished
- UI with visualization of protagonist's health and energy bars.
- Synchronized graphical and text-based world status representations.
- Implemented zoom in/out and scaling in graphical view.
- XEnemy with unique behavior including random health and teleportation.

### Future Improvements
